# Intel(R) Threat Detection Technology (TDT)

Intel(R) Threat Detection Technology comprises of a set of libraries and a public API interface that uses low level CPU telemetry data to perform early detection of advanced malware threats. It is intended for Independent Security Vendors (ISVs) and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) to integrate with their security solutions and add signature less hardware based runtime threat detection capability. Through its solution stack Intel TDT enables deployment of advanced machine learning based classification and modeling algorithms to learn system behaviors and profile threats with CPU telemetry as feature vectors. Upon detection of malicious activity notifications are generated for further investigation and remediation by the integrating security application. TDT’s APIs, telemetry framework and Machine Learning pipeline also provide security applications the opportunity to build their own detection heuristics to address threats of interest to them.

## Intel(R) Security Libraries (SecL) – DC integration
Intel® SecL-TDT is a new feature set added to Intel® SecL-DC security solutions for adding runtime threat detection and anomaly detection support with hardware telemetry and machine learning in the data center and cloud.
ISecL-TDT provides two components:

* **Intel® SecL Threat Detection Agent (TDA)** – a user level application running as a daemon to be deployed on each managed server node. This agent integrates the TDT libraries and provides REST APIs to discover TDT heuristic capabilities on the node and subsequently configure and manage those heuristics. The TDA also pushes TDT detection event reports (notifications) to the TDS.
* **Intel® SecL Threat Detection Service (TDS)** - a service or daemon that can be deployed in baremetal, VM or container that receives the threat event report from TDA and provides REST APIs for threat event query and other APIs for management.

Refer to Intel(R) SecL-TDT documentation to use TDT with Intel(R) SecL.

## TDT API

Public API intended for applications integrating TDT libraries.

`C – Application\library\tdt_agent.h`
`C++ – Application\library\tdt_agent.hpp`
`Go - Application\library\golang\src\tdt_lib\tdt_agent.go`

Please refer to code documentation in the headers for invocation details.


## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

TDT threat detection heuristics are dependent on CPU telemetry generated by Intel CPUs and are thus applicable only on Intel platforms.
Individual heuristics may have their own minimum CPU SKU requirement depending on the kind of metrics being used by the heuristic.

*TDT is only supported on Intel 6th generation (SkyLake) and later Core and Xeon CPU families at this time.*

A minimum of 8GBs of RAM is recommended.

### Build and Runtime Requirements

* Linux Kernel 3.1 or up

* [CMake] (https://cmake.org/) 3.11.2 or up
* GCC

    - 7.x or better on non-RHEL distributions

    - 4.8.5 or better with devtoolset-7 on RHEL distributions

* [Boost] (https://www.boost.org/) 1.68 or up.

* [Intel Thread Building Blocks (TBB)] (https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-tbb)

* perf (included with kernel). This is required for execution only, no build dependencies.

Please setup internet settings to let CMake download the proper versions of Boost and TBB during the build process.

The TDT PMU publisher plugin interfaces with the perf kernel module that comes built-in with the Linux kernel. This requires the plugin to execute with root/admin privileges and have permissions to invoke the perf_event_open syscall.

Security applications integrating TDT may execute directly with root/admin privileges. Alternatively, administrators can use kernel namespaces and control groups to allow perf_event subsystem access for the app from the non-root user or isolation context (e.g. containers) it is executing in.


### Build Instructions

TDT is built using cmake.

* Open a terminal and set proxy settings allow download of Boost and TBB automatically (This step is only required in case of using proxy to access the Internet)
`$ export HTTP_PROXY=http://<proxy>:<port>`
`$ export HTTPS_PROXY=https://<proxy>:<port>`

* Navigate to the root of the TDT source directory

* Create the build directory and configure and build the TDT libraries and release package
`$ ./compile.sh`

* The built binaries and configuration files will be copied to the release_package folder in the source root folder.
